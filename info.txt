Here was my function to pull data from api.weatherstack.com - the current weather json response was nearly identical to the weather underground data, even including a url to a weather gif. Here's the code, just put your key, city, state, and units in the constructor like normal-



async getWeather (city, state) {
    const weatherResponse = await fetch(`http://api.weatherstack.com/current?access_key=${this.apiKey}&query=${city},${state}&units=${this.units}`);
 
    const weatherData = await weatherResponse.json();
 
    return weatherData;
  }
